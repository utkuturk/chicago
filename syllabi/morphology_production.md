## 1. Course Description

When do we plan inflectional morphology? This seminar connects theory about production and morphological encoding to experiments that can test it. You will evaluate core claims, design studies with explicit predictions, and build practical skills in implementation, analysis, and modeling. Think of us as colleagues working on the same project together—my goal is to help you develop the best possible project, not just evaluate it at the end. The quarter ends with an original proposal or pilot, written in article format.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.  Evaluate competing accounts of morphological planning in production.
2.  Turn theoretical claims into concrete predictions and falsifiable tests.
3.  Design experiments with appropriate controls, counterbalancing, and exclusions.
4.  Implement web-based production tasks in PCIbex (timing + audio).
5.  Analyze timing/error data in R (mixed models).
6.  Design cross-linguistic experiments that test morphological planning.
7.  Conduct power analyses and interpret model comparison metrics.
8.  Present and defend an experimental design.
9.  Write preregistered analysis plans with reproducible workflows.

## 3. Course Structure

### Weekly Rhythm
| Component | What it looks like |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Readings** | Short **required** core + **recommended** breadth + a **depth pick** (read fully). |
| **Mini-lecture** | Claim, design logic, and what pattern would change minds. (30 min) |
| **Studio/Lab** | 90 minutes: PCIbex builds, R analysis, or modeling/simulation. |
| **Peer Workshop** | 30 minutes: Share work-in-progress, get feedback, troubleshoot together. |
| **Problem sets** | Three deliverables scaffolding the final project. |
| **Project** | Idea → design → analysis → write-up. |

### The Studio Model
This seminar runs like an **art studio** or **maker space**—not a lecture hall. Half our time is spent building: writing code, designing experiments, debugging analyses. I'll circulate and work with you individually or in small groups.

**Expect to:**
- Show unfinished work and get feedback (that's how we learn!)
- Help each other debug code and brainstorm designs
- Present work-in-progress multiple times, not just at the end
- Iterate based on peer and instructor feedback

**Studio Sessions Include:**
- **Week 3**: PCIbex build-athon—bring your laptop, build a minimal naming experiment
- **Week 5**: Analysis clinic—bring your data, we'll wrangle it together
- **Week 7**: Design workshop—pitch your final project idea, get feedback
- **Week 9**: Cross-linguistic design exchange—pair up and critique each other's designs

### A Collaborative Approach
**Think of us as colleagues working on the same project together.** Reach out anytime with questions about your design, feedback on materials, or coding problems.

## 6. Policies

### 6.1 Attendance
Attendance is expected. Email me if you must miss class. You are responsible for catching up on lab content.

### 6.2 Late Work
*   **Reading questions:** No late submissions (part of participation).
*   **Problem sets:** 10% penalty per day (max 3 days).
*   **Project:** Extensions by arrangement only.

### 6.3 Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged! Discuss approaches, but write your own code and analysis.

### 6.4 Academic Integrity

### 6.5 Use of LLMs
LLMs (ChatGPT, etc.) are allowed for **support** (debugging, brainstorming) but not generation. You must document use.

### 6.6 Accessibility & Wellness
If you need accommodations, please register with the relevant accessibility office and talk to me early in the quarter. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.

## 9. Connection to Course Sequence

This course is **Course 3** (capstone) in the Experimental Psycholinguistics sequence:
- **Course 1:** Intro to Psycholinguistics (undergrad) - Fall Quarter
- **Course 2:** Bayesian Cognitive Modeling (mixed) - Winter Quarter
- **Course 3 (this course):** Morphological Planning in Production (grad) - Spring Quarter

**Skills from previous courses that are essential here:**
- **From Course 1:**
  - R programming (ggplot2, dplyr)
  - Mixed-effects models (lme4)
  - Experimental design logic
  - PCIbex basics (if covered)
- **From Course 2:**

**Integration in Course 3:**
- **Experiments:** Design production tasks (Course 1 skills)
- **Models:** Fit hierarchical Bayesian models to production data (Course 2 skills)
- **Theory:** Connect findings to morphological theory (new in Course 3)

**Can be taken standalone** if you have:

## 10. Who Should Take This Course

### Good fit if you:
- Want to conduct original production research
- Are interested in morphological planning / agreement / speech errors
- Comfortable with R and willing to learn PCIbex
- Like hands-on, studio-style learning (not just reading papers)
- Planning a dissertation or QP on production topics

### May struggle if you:
- No prior psycholinguistics background (take Course 1 first)
- Uncomfortable with programming (Course 1 or 2 will help)
- Prefer lecture-style seminars to studio/lab format
- Find 10-week quarters overwhelming

### For advanced graduate students:
This seminar is ideal if you're:
- Preparing a QP or dissertation on production
- Developing experimental skills for your research program
- Seeking publication-ready proposals for psycholinguistics journals (e.g., *JML*, *Cognition*, *LCP*)

---

## 11. Expected Background

### Assumed Knowledge
You should be comfortable with:
- **Psycholinguistics concepts:** Production architecture, incremental planning, lexical access
- **R programming:** Data wrangling (dplyr), visualization (ggplot2), mixed models (lme4)
- **Statistics:** Mixed-effects models, understanding interactions, model comparison

### Will Learn in This Course
- **PCIbex:** Web-based production experiments (audio recording, timing)
- **Morphological theory:** How production models connect to morphosyntactic theory
- **Cross-linguistic design:** Leveraging typological differences to test theories
- **Preregistration:** Writing analysis plans before seeing data

---

## 12. Final Project Expectations

Your final project should:

1. **Motivate a research question** from production theory (2-3 pages)
2. **Review relevant literature** critically (2-3 pages)
3. **Propose an experiment** with:
   - Explicit predictions from competing theories
   - Materials (example items)
   - Design (conditions, counterbalancing, exclusions)
   - Preregistered analysis plan (models, contrasts)
4. **Include pilot data (optional)** or **detailed power analysis**
5. **Discuss implications** for theory and future directions (1-2 pages)

**Format:** ACL/LSA/Cognition style (10 pages)

**Outcome:** Should be submittable to a conference (HSP, LSA, CUNY) or workshop with minor revisions.

---

## 13. Instructor Note

This seminar is the capstone of the sequence, where you apply everything you've learned to tackle an active research question. The quarter format is intense, but the studio model ensures you get individualized feedback and hands-on support.

By Week 10, you should have a conference-ready proposal that you're excited to continue working on. Many students turn these projects into QPs, dissertation chapters, or first-author publications.

I'm committed to helping you develop the best possible project. Use office hours, ask questions, workshop your ideas with peers. This is a collaborative research environment, not a traditional seminar.

Looking forward to building experiments and testing theories together.

Best,
Utku Turk
