## 1. Course Description

When do we plan inflectional morphology? This seminar connects theory about production and morphological encoding to experiments that can test it. You will evaluate core claims, design studies with explicit predictions, and build practical skills in implementation, analysis, and modeling. Think of us as colleagues working on the same project together—my goal is to help you develop the best possible project, not just evaluate it at the end. The semester ends with an original proposal or pilot, written in article format.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.  Evaluate competing accounts of morphological planning in production.
2.  Turn theoretical claims into concrete predictions and falsifiable tests.
3.  Design experiments with appropriate controls, counterbalancing, and exclusions.
4.  Implement web-based production tasks in PCIbex (timing + audio).
5.  Analyze timing/error data in R (mixed models).
6.  Design cross-linguistic experiments that test morphological planning.
7.  Conduct power analyses and interpret model comparison metrics.
8.  Present and defend an experimental design.
9.  Write preregistered analysis plans with reproducible workflows.

## 3. Course Structure

### Weekly Rhythm
| Component | What it looks like |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Readings** | Short **required** core + **recommended** breadth + a **depth pick** (read fully). |
| **Mini-lecture** | Claim, design logic, and what pattern would change minds. (30 min) |
| **Studio/Lab** | 45--60 minutes: PCIbex builds, R analysis, or modeling/simulation. |
| **Peer Workshop** | 30 minutes: Share work-in-progress, get feedback, troubleshoot together. |
| **Problem sets** | Three deliverables scaffolding the final project. |
| **Project** | Idea → design → analysis → write-up. |

### The Studio Model
This seminar runs like an **art studio** or **maker space**—not a lecture hall. Half our time is spent building: writing code, designing experiments, debugging analyses. I'll circulate and work with you individually or in small groups.

**Expect to:**
- Show unfinished work and get feedback (that's how we learn!)
- Help each other debug code and brainstorm designs
- Present work-in-progress multiple times, not just at the end
- Iterate based on peer and instructor feedback

**Studio Sessions Include:**
- **Week 3**: PCIbex build-athon—bring your laptop, build a minimal naming experiment
- **Week 6**: Analysis clinic—bring your messiest data, we'll wrangle it together
- **Week 9**: Design workshop—pitch your final project idea, get feedback
- **Week 12**: Cross-linguistic design exchange—pair up and critique each other's designs

### A Collaborative Approach
**Think of us as colleagues working on the same project together.** Reach out anytime with questions about your design, feedback on materials, or coding problems.

## 6. Policies

### 6.1 Attendance
Attendance is expected. Email me if you must miss class. You are responsible for catching up on lab content.

### 6.2 Late Work
*   **Reading questions:** No late submissions.
*   **Problem sets:** 10% penalty per day (max 3 days).
*   **Project:** Extensions by arrangement only.

### 6.3 Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged! Discuss approaches, but write your own code and analysis.

### 6.4 Academic Integrity
Do your own work; cite sources. Plagiarism or fabrication result in failure.

### 6.5 Use of LLMs
LLMs (ChatGPT, etc.) are allowed for **support** (debugging, brainstorming) but not generation. You must document use.

### 6.6 Accessibility & Wellness
If you need accommodations, please register with the relevant accessibility office and talk to me early in the semester. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.
