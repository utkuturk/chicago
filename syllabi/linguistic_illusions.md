## 1. Course Description

Why do we accept sentences that are ungrammatical? Why do we reject sentences that are well-formed? This seminar explores **Linguistic Illusions**: phenomena where our real-time processing of language systematically deviates from the dictates of our internal grammar.

Just as visual illusions reveal the heuristics of the visual system, linguistic illusions provide a window into the architecture of the language parser. We'll cover the full taxonomy of known illusions—semantic, structural, and comparative—and use them to evaluate competing theories of sentence processing. I'm excited to debate these mechanisms with you as we try to reverse-engineer the mind together. This is a collaborative intellectual journey, not a competition.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.  Categorize major types of linguistic illusions (e.g., agreement attraction, NPI illusions, comparative illusions).
2.  Critically evaluate theoretical accounts of why illusions occur (e.g., retrieval interference vs. rational inference).
3.  Synthesize complex experimental literature into concise summaries.
4.  Identify theoretical gaps in the current understanding of sentence processing.

## 3. Course Structure

This is a reading-intensive graduate seminar built around **intellectual combat**.
1.  **Weekly Readings:** We will read 2-3 primary source papers per week covering a specific illusion.
2.  **Discussion:** Class time is dedicated to dissecting the mechanisms proposed for these illusions. Come prepared to defend a position—and to have your mind changed.
3.  **Synthesis:** You must submit a 1-page synthesis of the readings every week.

### The Debate Format
Each week, we'll examine competing theoretical accounts:
- **Shallow Processing** (Ferreira & Patson): People use "good enough" heuristics
- **Cue-Based Retrieval** (Lewis & Vasishth): Interference during memory access
- **Noisy Channel** (Levy, Gibson): Rational inference under uncertainty

You will be assigned to defend a theoretical position for certain weeks. Your job: make the strongest possible case for your assigned mechanism, even if you don't believe it. This forces you to engage deeply with each theory's logic and predictions. But remember—we're all on the same team here, trying to understand how language works. Strong disagreement is encouraged; disrespect is not.

### Illusion of the Week
Each week features one illusion type with a provocative question:
- **Week 2**: Moses Illusion—Do people really not notice "Moses" vs. "Noah"?
- **Week 5**: Agreement Attraction—Is this memory failure or shallow processing?
- **Week 7**: NPI Illusions—Can the parser "hallucinate" licensors?
- **Week 8**: Missing VP—Why can't we parse center-embedded sentences?

For each illusion, ask: What would it take to convince you this is NOT an illusion but a feature?

## 4. Course Requirements

### 4.1 Grading
| Item | % | What counts |
| :--- | :--: | :--- |
| Participation | 20 | Active engagement in seminar discussions. |
| Weekly Synthesis | 40 | A 1-page synthesis of readings (Due 24h before class). |
| Presentation | 10 | Leading the discussion for one topic. |
| Final Project | 30 | A 4-page "Missing Links" paper. |

### 4.2 Weekly Synthesis
One page, identifying the core theoretical conflict, evidence, and open questions (not a summary).

### 4.3 Final Project: "What was missing?" (Replication-and-Extension Essay)
A 4-page critical essay identifying a gap in the illusions literature—a confound, unstudied language, alternative mechanism, or methodological flaw—and proposing how a replication-and-extension study would address it.

## 6. Policies

### 6.1 Mental Health & Wellness
Graduate school is challenging, and this seminar is intellectually demanding. If you're struggling—academically, personally, or emotionally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together. Your health and wellbeing are more important than any assignment or deadline.

If you need to miss class or need an extension, just let me know. I trust you to manage your own wellbeing, and I'm here to support you however I can.

### 6.2 Accessibility
If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and talk to me early in the semester.
