## 1. Course Description

How do we study language in the mind? How do psycholinguists design experiments to test linguistic theories? What does it take to go from a theoretical question to publishable experimental results?

This course teaches psycholinguistics **through the experimental process**. Rather than just reading about experiments, we will learn by doing: formulating research questions, designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing results, and presenting findings. I am excited to guide you through this process as we act as colleagues discovering new things about the mind.

You will work through the complete research cycle multiple times, each time with a different linguistic domain: speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing, agreement processing, prediction, and semantic interpretation. By the end of the semester, you will have hands-on experience with every stage of psycholinguistic research and a deep understanding of how experimental methods connect to linguistic theory.

**No prior experimental experience required**—we learn by doing, starting from scratch.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.  Formulate testable research questions from linguistic theories.
2.  Design experiments using appropriate psycholinguistic methods.
3.  Understand and apply methods: self-paced reading, eye-tracking, acceptability judgments, priming.
4.  Collect experimental data using online platforms (PCIbex, Gorilla).
5.  Analyze psycholinguistic data using R and mixed-effects models.
6.  Interpret experimental results in light of linguistic theory.
7.  Write research papers following APA/journal format.
8.  Present experimental findings to both specialist and general audiences.
9.  Critically evaluate published psycholinguistic research.
10. Connect experimental findings to theoretical linguistics.

## 3. Course Structure

The course is organized around **six stages of the experimental process**. Each unit focuses on one stage and one linguistic phenomenon:

1.  **Question Formation** (Weeks 1--3): Speech perception & phonological categories
2.  **Literature Review** (Weeks 4--6): Lexical access & word recognition
3.  **Experimental Design** (Weeks 7--9): Garden-path effects & parsing
4.  **Data Collection** (Weeks 10--11): Language Production & Planning
5.  **Data Analysis** (Weeks 12--13): Analyzing Production & Model Commitments
6.  **Writing & Presentation** (Weeks 14--16): Final projects

### Weekly Rhythm
| Component | What it looks like |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lecture** | Linguistic phenomenon + experimental methods (Tue). |
| **Lab** | Hands-on work with that stage of the process (Thu). |
| **QALMRI summaries** | Critical reading of experimental papers (6 total). |
| **HSP conference project** | Attending talks, synthesizing research (special assignment). |

### Methods We Use
*   **Self-paced reading:** Measuring reading times word-by-word.
*   **Eye-tracking:** Recording eye movements during reading.
*   **Acceptability judgments:** Rating grammaticality and naturalness.
*   **Priming:** Testing facilitation effects.
*   **Online platforms:** PCIbex, Gorilla for data collection.
*   **Analysis:** R, lme4 for mixed-effects models.

### Your Experiment Building Timeline
By the end of the semester, you will have built multiple mini-experiments:
- **Week 3**: Design your first experiment (speech perception)
- **Week 6**: Conduct a literature review with experimental predictions
- **Week 9**: Full experiment design with materials and analysis plan
- **Week 11**: Collect real data from participants
- **Week 13**: Analyze and visualize your own experimental data
- **Week 16**: Present a complete study from question to conclusion

Think of this course as an apprenticeship: you'll do what psycholinguists do, not just read about it.

## 4. Course Requirements

### 4.1 Grading
| Item | % | What counts |
| :--- | :--: | :--- |
| Participation | 15 | Active engagement in lectures and labs. |
| QALMRI summaries (6x) | 30 | Critical paper summaries (5% each). |
| Stage assignments (5x) | 30 | Hands-on work at each experimental stage (6% each). |
| HSP conference project | 10 | Attending talks; synthesis write-up. |
| Final project | 15 | Complete experimental study: design, data, analysis, paper. |

### 4.2 QALMRI Summaries
QALMRI (Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, Inferences) is a framework for critically reading experimental papers. You will write 6 summaries over the semester (1-2 pages each).

### 4.3 Stage Assignments
At each stage, you will complete a hands-on assignment:
1.  **Question formation:** Develop a research question.
2.  **Literature review:** Write a mini literature review (3--4 pages).
3.  **Experimental design (Replication-and-Extension):** Choose a classic psycholinguistics finding, identify a confound or alternative explanation, and design a minimal follow-up experiment that would adjudicate between competing accounts.
4.  **Data collection:** Collect pilot data online.
5.  **Data analysis:** Analyze data and visualize results.

### 4.4 HSP Conference Project
You will attend simulated or real sessions of the Human Sentence Processing (HSP) conference and write a synthesis of 3 talks/posters relevant to your interests.

### 4.5 Final Project
Design and execute a complete psycholinguistic experiment. Format: 12--15 page paper in APA style + 10-minute presentation.
