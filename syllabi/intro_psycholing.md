## 1. Course Description

How do we study language in the mind? How do psycholinguists design experiments to test linguistic theories? What does it take to go from a theoretical question to publishable experimental results?

This course teaches psycholinguistics **through the experimental process**. Rather than just reading about experiments, we will learn by doing: formulating research questions, designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing results, and presenting findings. I am excited to guide you through this process as we act as colleagues discovering new things about the mind.

You will work through the complete research cycle multiple times, each time with a different linguistic domain: speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing, and language production. By the end of the quarter, you will have hands-on experience with every stage of psycholinguistic research and a deep understanding of how experimental methods connect to linguistic theory.

**No prior experimental experience required**—we learn by doing, starting from scratch.

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Formulate testable research questions from linguistic theories.
2.  Design experiments using appropriate psycholinguistic methods.
3.  Understand and apply methods: self-paced reading, eye-tracking, acceptability judgments, priming.
4.  Collect experimental data using online platforms (PCIbex, Gorilla).
5.  Analyze psycholinguistic data using R and mixed-effects models.
6.  Interpret experimental results in light of linguistic theory.
7.  Write research papers following APA/journal format.
8.  Present experimental findings to both specialist and general audiences.
9.  Critically evaluate published psycholinguistic research.
10. Connect experimental findings to theoretical linguistics.

## 3. Course Structure

The course is organized around **five stages of the experimental process**. Each unit focuses on one stage and one linguistic phenomenon:

1.  **Question Formation** (Week 1): Introduction to psycholinguistics & speech perception
2.  **Literature Review** (Weeks 2--3): Lexical access & word recognition
3.  **Experimental Design** (Weeks 4--5): Garden-path effects & parsing
4.  **Data Collection** (Weeks 6--7): Language Production & Planning
5.  **Data Analysis & Presentation** (Weeks 8--10): Analysis methods & final projects

### Weekly Rhythm
| Component | What it looks like |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lecture** | Linguistic phenomenon + experimental methods (Session 1). |
| **Lab** | Hands-on work with that stage of the process (Session 2). |
| **QALMRI summaries** | Critical reading of experimental papers (4 total). |
| **Stage projects** | Mini-projects at key experimental stages (3 total). |

### Methods We Use
*   **Self-paced reading:** Measuring reading times word-by-word.
*   **Eye-tracking:** Recording eye movements during reading.
*   **Acceptability judgments:** Rating grammaticality and naturalness.
*   **Priming:** Testing facilitation effects.
*   **Online platforms:** PCIbex, Gorilla for data collection.
*   **Analysis:** R, lme4 for mixed-effects models.

### Your Experiment Building Timeline

By the end of the quarter, you will have built multiple mini-experiments:
- **Week 2**: Design your first experiment (speech perception)
- **Week 4**: Conduct a literature review with experimental predictions
- **Week 6**: Full experiment design with materials and analysis plan
- **Week 8**: Analyze and visualize experimental data
- **Week 10**: Present a complete study from question to conclusion

Think of this course as an apprenticeship: you'll do what psycholinguists do, not just read about it.

## 6. Policies

### 6.1 Quarter System Considerations

This course covers substantial material in 10 weeks. To succeed:

*   **Time management:** Expect 10-12 hours/week outside class. Start assignments early.
*   **Reading strategy:** Use the QALMRI framework. Focus on core readings; optional readings available for depth.
*   **Lab attendance:** Critical—skills build cumulatively. Missing labs puts you behind.
*   **Office hours:** Use them! Especially for R programming and experimental design help.

### 6.2 What you might struggle with (and how to succeed)

*   **Learning R:** Start with small examples. Visualize everything. Use online resources (R for Data Science).
*   **Designing experiments:** Start simple. Pilot everything. Get feedback early.
*   **Reading papers:** Don't read linearly. Use QALMRI. Focus on method and results first.
*   **Quarter pace:** Unlike semesters, there's no "catching up later." Stay current.

### 6.3 Accessibility & Wellness

If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and talk to me early in the quarter. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.

### 6.4 Academic Integrity

Do your own work. You may collaborate on understanding concepts and debugging code, but write your own analyses and summaries. Cite all sources.

### 6.5 Use of LLMs

LLMs (ChatGPT, etc.) may be used for **support** (understanding concepts, debugging R code) but not to generate QALMRI summaries or written assignments. Document any use.

## 9. Connection to Course Sequence

This course is **Course 1** in the Experimental Psycholinguistics sequence:

- **Course 1 (this course):** Intro to Psycholinguistics (undergrad) - Fall Quarter
- **Course 2:** Bayesian Cognitive Modeling (mixed) - Winter Quarter
- **Course 3:** Morphological Planning in Production (grad) - Spring Quarter

**Skills that transfer to Course 2:**

- R programming → used for Stan modeling
- Experimental thinking → applied to computational models
- Mixed-effects models → extended to hierarchical Bayesian models

**Not a prerequisite but helpful preparation** for advanced psycholinguistics seminars and research assistantships.

## 10. Instructor Note

Welcome to the quarter! Ten weeks is short, but I'm committed to making sure you get the full psycholinguistics research experience. We'll move fast, but we'll move together. Don't hesitate to reach out for help, feedback, or just to talk about language science.

Looking forward to discovering new things about the mind with you.

Best,
Utku Turk
