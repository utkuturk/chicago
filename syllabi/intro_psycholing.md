# Introduction to Psycholinguistics
**Learning Through the Experimental Process**

## Course Overview

This course introduces psycholinguistics through direct engagement with the experimental process. Rather than just surveying what psycholinguists have discovered, you'll learn by conducting research yourself: formulating testable hypotheses, designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing results, and communicating findings.

The semester is organized around six stages of experimental research, each focusing on a different linguistic domain. You'll work through the complete pipeline multiple times, building competence with methods, statistical analysis, and scientific communication. I'm excited to guide you through this hands-on approach—I think the best way to understand psycholinguistics is to actually do it.

**Prerequisites**: Introduction to linguistics or permission. No experimental experience required.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:
1. Formulate testable research questions from linguistic theories
2. Design psycholinguistic experiments with appropriate controls
3. Implement experiments using self-paced reading, eye-tracking, acceptability judgments, and priming paradigms
4. Collect experimental data using online platforms (PCIbex, Gorilla)
5. Analyze psycholinguistic data using R and mixed-effects models
6. Interpret experimental results in relation to linguistic theory
7. Write research papers in APA/journal format
8. Critically evaluate published psycholinguistic research

## Course Structure: The Six-Stage Experimental Cycle

### Stage 1: Question Formation (Weeks 1-3)
**Domain**: Speech Perception & Phonological Categories

Students learn to translate theoretical questions into empirically testable hypotheses. We examine categorical perception experiments and design studies testing whether phonological categories are innate or learned.

**Deliverable**: Experimental design proposal (Week 3)

### Stage 2: Literature Review (Weeks 4-6)
**Domain**: Lexical Access & Word Recognition

Students conduct systematic literature reviews using databases and citation tracking. We study lexical competition using the visual world paradigm and priming experiments.

**Deliverable**: Annotated bibliography and synthesis (3-4 pages, Week 6)

### Stage 3: Experimental Design (Weeks 7-9)
**Domain**: Syntactic Parsing & Garden-Path Effects

Students design complete experiments including materials, counterbalancing, fillers, and analysis plans. We examine how working memory constraints affect sentence processing.

**Deliverable**: Full experimental design with materials and predictions (Week 9)

### Stage 4: Data Collection (Weeks 10-11)
**Domain**: Language Production & Agreement Errors

Students implement experiments online and collect pilot data. We investigate agreement attraction in production: why speakers produce errors like "The key to the cabinets are on the table."

**Deliverable**: Pilot data collection report (Week 11)

### Stage 5: Data Analysis (Weeks 12-13)
**Domain**: Statistical Modeling & Theoretical Commitments

Students analyze experimental data, fit mixed-effects models, and interpret results. We examine how statistical modeling choices reflect theoretical assumptions about cognition.

**Deliverable**: Data analysis with visualization (Week 13)

### Stage 6: Scientific Communication (Weeks 14-16)
**Domain**: Writing & Presentation

Students write complete research papers and present findings. We discuss how to communicate experimental results to specialist and general audiences.

**Deliverable**: Final project paper and presentation (Week 16)

## Reading Framework: QALMRI

All paper readings use the QALMRI framework:
- **Question**: What is the research question?
- **Alternatives**: What are competing hypotheses?
- **Logic**: How does the experimental design test between them?
- **Method**: What procedures were used?
- **Results**: What patterns emerged?
- **Inferences**: What do results tell us about theory?

You'll submit 6 QALMRI summaries (1-2 pages each) throughout the semester, replacing traditional exams. This framework helps you read like a researcher, not just a student memorizing facts.

- Collect pilot data from participants
- Analyze results using appropriate statistical methods
- Write findings in journal format (12-15 pages, APA style)
- Present study to the class (10-minute presentation)

Projects should demonstrate mastery of the complete experimental workflow.

## Required Texts

Available online or through the library:
- Harley (2014). *The Psychology of Language: From Data to Theory*

## Policies

### Attendance & Participation
Regular attendance is expected. Laboratory sessions are hands-on and cannot be made up easily. Contact me in advance if you must miss class.

### Late Work
Stage assignments may be submitted up to 3 days late with 10% penalty per day. Final project extensions require advance arrangement.

### Academic Integrity
All work must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, but write-ups must be individual. Plagiarism results in course failure.

### Accessibility & Accommodations
If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and notify me as early as possible in the semester. I'm committed to ensuring all students can succeed in this course.

If you're struggling—whether with the material, experimental design, coding, or anything else—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together. Your wellbeing matters more than any assignment.
