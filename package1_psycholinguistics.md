# Package 1: Experimental Psycholinguistics Sequence
**Instructor:** Utku Turk (utkuturk@umd.edu)
**Format:** Quarter System (10 weeks per course)
**Level Progression:** Undergraduate → Mixed → Advanced Graduate

---

## Package Vision

This three-course sequence trains students in experimental psycholinguistics, from foundational methods through computational modeling to specialized research in morphological planning. Students learn by doing: formulating questions, designing experiments, implementing models, collecting data, and presenting findings. Each course integrates programming (R, Stan, PCIbex), statistical analysis, and theoretical linguistics, preparing students for modern psycholinguistics research.

## Course Summaries

### Course 1: Introduction to Psycholinguistics (Undergraduate, Fall Quarter)
**Prerequisites:** Introduction to Linguistics or permission

Students learn psycholinguistics through the complete experimental process. Rather than just reading about experiments, they design them, collect data, analyze results, and present findings. The course covers speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing, and language production. By the end of the quarter, students have hands-on experience with self-paced reading, eye-tracking, acceptability judgments, and online experimentation (PCIbex, Gorilla). They learn R programming, mixed-effects models, and APA-format research writing. No prior experimental experience required—skills build from scratch.

**Key outputs:** 4 QALMRI paper summaries, 3 stage projects (question formation, experimental design, data analysis), final experimental proposal.

### Course 2: Bayesian Cognitive Modeling for Linguistics (Mixed Level, Winter Quarter)
**Prerequisites:** Introduction to programming (R or Python) and basic statistics

This course teaches students to formalize theories of cognition computationally using Bayesian modeling. Unlike traditional statistics ("is there an effect?"), cognitive modeling asks "what underlying process generated this data?" Students learn probabilistic programming in **Stan**, implementing models from Signal Detection Theory to hierarchical memory models. The workflow covers theory formalization, Stan implementation, parameter recovery through simulation, application to real data, and robustness evaluation. Mathematical intuition builds through visualization and analogy, not calculus.

**Key outputs:** 7 weekly lab implementations, midterm model replication (SDT or GCM), final project implementing a novel Bayesian cognitive model.

### Course 3: Morphological Planning in Production (Advanced Graduate, Spring Quarter)
**Prerequisites:** Background in psycholinguistics or permission

This advanced seminar investigates when and how speakers plan inflectional morphology during sentence production. Students evaluate competing theoretical accounts (Levelt, Dell, Caramazza), design experiments that test explicit predictions, and build practical skills in PCIbex implementation, production timing analysis, and cross-linguistic design. The course runs as a **studio/maker space**—half our time is spent building experiments and debugging analyses together. Students develop original research proposals suitable for conference submission (HSP, LSA, CUNY) or publication in psycholinguistics journals.

**Key outputs:** 3 problem sets (PCIbex build, R analysis pipeline, cross-linguistic design), article-format final project (10-15 pages) with preregistered analysis plan.

## Learning Philosophy

This sequence embodies three core principles. **First, learning by doing:** students conduct research, not just read about it. **Second, acting as colleagues:** the instructor's role shifts from guide (Course 1) to mentor (Course 2) to collaborator (Course 3). **Third, computational literacy:** programming is embedded throughout as a tool for answering linguistic questions. Students completing all three courses can design rigorous experiments, implement computational models, and contribute original findings to the field.

---

**Progression:** Course 1 provides experimental foundations → Course 2 adds computational modeling → Course 3 integrates both in specialized research. Skills build cumulatively: R programming (all courses), experimental design (Courses 1 & 3), Bayesian modeling (Courses 2 & 3), production methods (Course 3).
