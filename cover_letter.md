Dear Professor Kennedy and Members of the Search Committee,

I am writing to apply for the position of Instructional Professor in
Linguistics and Cognitive Science. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics
at the University of Maryland (ABD; expected May 2027, can defend August
2026), holding a certificate in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science. My
background combines theoretical morphosyntax and formal semantics with
psycholinguistics and computational modeling. I am eager to bring this
interdisciplinary perspective to the University of Chicago, where I can
contribute to the curriculum in both Linguistics and the Cognitive
Science major.

I view teaching as a collaboration in inquiry: a process where students
learn to think critically about cognitive architecture while the
instructor evaluates their own fundamental assumptions. I am prepared to
contribute across your curriculum in two primary clusters, and integrate
them to the existing theoretical research landscape in the University of
Chicago.

The Cognitive-Linguistic Interface. For courses such as
*Psycholinguistics*, *Language Processing*, and *Language and Memory*, I
guide students through the cognitive architecture of the language
faculty. Rather than presenting a static history of the field, I utilize
a student-driven model where learners evaluate how to derive the details
of established theories from initial principles. I integrate real-world
datasets from my own and other colleague's research, spanning Turkish,
German, Russian, and English, to demonstrate how typological diversity
can dissociate factors often confounded in a single language. By using
case studies on agreement attraction and grammatical timing, I help
students understand how broader theoretical debates---such as memory
retrieval and response bias---shape our understanding of constraints on
linguistic representation, as well as how to connect linguistic theory
with these biological constraints.

Computational and Quantitative Inquiry. In courses like *Quantitative
Research Methods*, I employ a simulation-based pedagogical approach that
prioritizes statistical intuition over rote formalism. Students learn to
think like a model by simulating data and using statistical agents to
reverse-engineer the cognitive underpinnings of experimental results,
and eventually verify their models with established formalisms. In
*Cognitive Models and AI*, I treat computational tools ranging from
Bayesian models to Large Language Models (LLMs) as instruments to
explicate verbal theories. Drawing on my work with cross-linguistic LLM
syncretism, I teach students that these models are not just ends in
themselves, but tools to test internal logic. This ensures students
remain focused on cognitive science questions rather than becoming lost
in the hype around the tools.

Curriculum Development and Mentorship. My preparation for the
Instructional Professor role relies on significant experience designing
workshops and mentoring diverse student cohorts. I initiated a graduate
workshop on Bayesian Data Analysis at Maryland's Language Science Center
and co-organized a sentence production workshop at Oxford. I have
mentored students in implementing research using PCIbex, Montreal Forced
Aligner, and R/Stan, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical
questions and technical implementation. I am also prepared to teach core
foundational courses. At Boğaziçi University and Maryland, I served as a
TA for *Introduction to Linguistics*, *Syntax*, and *Morphology*. I look
forward to bringing this experience to the UChicago Core, ensuring that
even introductory students engage with linguistics as a discipline where
theoretical developments meet cognitive modelling and quantitative
research.

The University of Chicago\'s commitment to integrating theoretical
linguistics with cognitive and computational approaches makes it an
ideal home for my teaching profile. I am excited by the prospect of
contributing to the department\'s vibrant intellectual community and
mentoring the next generation of cognitive scientists. I have enclosed
my CV, teaching statement, and sample syllabi.

Sincerely,

Utku Türk Ph.D. Candidate, University of Maryland
