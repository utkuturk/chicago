<h1>Package 2: AI and Natural Language Processing Sequence</h1>
<strong>Instructor:</strong> Utku Turk (utkuturk@umd.edu)
<strong>Format:</strong> Quarter System (10 weeks per course)
<strong>Level Progression:</strong> Mixed (Undergrad/Grad) → Advanced Graduate

<hr>

<h2>Package Vision</h2>

<p>This two-course sequence bridges machine learning, NLP, and linguistic theory. Students learn to build neural models <strong>and</strong> use them as scientific instruments to investigate linguistic structure. Unlike typical NLP courses prioritizing engineering performance, this sequence maintains a linguistic focus: every model is interrogated for what it reveals about language. Students build models from scratch, probe their representations, and critically evaluate claims about AI capabilities. The sequence prepares students for interdisciplinary research in computational linguistics, whether in academia or industry.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Course Summaries</h2>

<h3>Course 1: Machine Learning for Language (Mixed Level, Fall Quarter)</h3>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None. No prior programming or math experience required.

<p>This course introduces neural networks and their applications to language, balancing technical foundations with linguistic questions. Students build neural networks from scratch—implementing backpropagation by hand, training word embeddings, constructing RNNs/LSTMs, and finally working with transformers and LLMs. But critically, every model is interrogated through three questions: (1) What can it do? (2) What can't it do? (3) What does that tell us about language? Students design probing experiments to test whether models capture syntactic dependencies, semantic relations, or merely surface heuristics. Python programming taught from scratch through hands-on labs in Google Colab.</p>

<strong>Key outputs:</strong> 4 homework assignments (coding + concepts), midterm classifier proposal, final research proposal (8-10 pages) investigating a linguistic question with neural networks.

<h3>Course 2: Advanced NLP & AI for Linguistics (Graduate Level, Winter Quarter)</h3>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Background in neural networks (Course 1 or equivalent)

<p>Neural networks are often treated as black boxes. In this advanced seminar, we open them up. Students learn cutting-edge interpretability methods: (1) <strong>probing classifiers</strong> to test for linguistic knowledge, (2) <strong>attention analysis</strong> to understand syntactic dependency encoding, and (3) <strong>causal intervention</strong> to establish causal relationships between model components and behavior. The course runs as a research workshop—students read 2024-2025 papers, lead critical discussions, implement state-of-the-art methods, and develop original research proposals. By the end, students can design rigorous interpretability experiments and contribute to debates about what neural models actually learn.</p>

<strong>Key outputs:</strong> 2 paper presentations, 3 method implementations (probing, attention, causality/geometry), final research paper (10-12 pages in ACL format) with code.

<hr>

<h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>

<p>This sequence embodies three core principles. <strong>First, linguistics first, engineering second:</strong> these courses prioritize linguistic questions over benchmark performance. <strong>Second, critical AI literacy:</strong> students question claims about AI capabilities—not "can LLMs do syntax?" but "what syntactic patterns do they capture?" <strong>Third, hands-on implementation:</strong> students implement backpropagation by hand, code transformers from scratch, and run causal interventions. Students completing both courses can build modern NLP systems, critically evaluate AI capabilities, and conduct interpretability research.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Progression:</strong> Course 1 teaches how to build and train neural models → Course 2 teaches how to probe and interpret them. Skills build cumulatively: Python/PyTorch (both courses), transformers (introduced in Course 1, analyzed in Course 2), critical evaluation (Course 1 foundations, Course 2 advanced methods).

<h2>1. Course Description</h2>

<p>How do neural networks learn to process language? Can they acquire grammatical knowledge from text alone? What can machine learning tell us about linguistic structure?</p>

<p>This course introduces neural networks and their applications to language, balancing technical foundations with linguistic questions. You will learn how to build text classifiers, train language models, and implement modern NLP systems. But you will also investigate what these models learn: Do they capture syntactic dependencies? Can they generalize across languages? How do their representations compare to human linguistic knowledge? I am excited to explore the intersection of these two fields with you as we build the technology of the future.</p>

<p>By the end of the quarter, you will be able to implement neural models in Python, design experiments to probe what they've learned, and critically evaluate claims about AI and language. This is a hands-on course that combines practical ML skills with linguistic analysis.</p>

<strong>No prior programming experience required</strong>—we build skills from scratch.

<hr>

<h2>2. Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement neural networks for text classification and language modeling in Python/PyTorch.</li>
<li>Understand word embeddings and how meaning is represented in vector space.</li>
<li>Build and train RNNs, LSTMs, and transformer models.</li>
<li>Design probing experiments to test what models learn about linguistic structure.</li>
<li>Analyze attention patterns and model representations.</li>
<li>Evaluate whether models learn syntax, semantics, or surface heuristics.</li>
<li>Apply neural models to practical NLP tasks (sentiment, translation, generation).</li>
<li>Critically evaluate claims about AI capabilities and limitations.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Three Questions</h3>

<p>Every model we study will be interrogated through three lenses:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What can it do?</strong> (Capabilities: tasks it solves, benchmarks it passes)</li>
<li><strong>What can't it do?</strong> (Limitations: where it fails, what it doesn't learn)</li>
<li><strong>What does that tell us about language?</strong> (Implications: what this reveals about linguistic structure and cognition)</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn't just a coding class or just a linguistics class—it's both. You'll build the models AND use them as scientific instruments to investigate language.</p>

<h3>Your Learning Arc</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Weeks 1-3</strong>: Build your own neural networks from scratch (no magic libraries—you'll implement backprop by hand!)</li>
<li><strong>Weeks 4-6</strong>: Explore what models learn about language structure (syntax, semantics, pragmatics)</li>
<li><strong>Weeks 7-9</strong>: Work with state-of-the-art transformers and LLMs</li>
<li><strong>Week 10</strong>: Critical evaluation—when do models succeed for the wrong reasons?</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Policies</h2>

<h3>6.1 What you might struggle with (and how to succeed)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time management:</strong> Expect 10-12 hours/week outside class. Start homework early.</li>
<li><strong>Python learning curve:</strong> Week 1-2 will be challenging if you're new to programming. Use office hours!</li>
<li><strong>Math anxiety:</strong> We explain through intuition and visualization, not proofs. Focus on understanding, not memorization.</li>
<li><strong>Reading papers:</strong> Read strategically. Focus on key contributions, not every detail.</li>
<li><strong>Coding:</strong> Debug systematically. Pair program. Use Google Colab so everyone has the same environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Quarter System Considerations</h3>

<p>This course moves <strong>fast</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Week 3 (quarter) = Week 5 (semester):</strong> Already implementing backprop by hand</li>
<li><strong>Week 7 (quarter) = Week 11 (semester):</strong> Already working with transformers</li>
<li><strong>No catching up later:</strong> Missing one week = missing 10% of content</li>
<li><strong>Use labs effectively:</strong> Don't skip session (b)—that's where you learn to code</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.3 Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Do your own work. You may collaborate on homework, but must write your own code and answers. Cite sources.</p>

<h3>6.4 Use of LLMs</h3>
<p>LLMs may be used for <strong>support</strong> (debugging, learning syntax) but not to generate solutions. Document any use.</p>

<strong>Pedagogical note:</strong> Part of this course is understanding how LLMs work. Using ChatGPT to solve homework defeats the purpose—you're trying to build the thing that ChatGPT is!

<h3>6.5 Accessibility & Wellness</h3>
<p>If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and talk to me early in the quarter. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.</p>

<li><strong>Attention mechanism</strong> (Week 6) - visualize what models attend to</li>
<li><strong>Transformer</strong> (Week 7) - self-attention and multi-head attention</li>
<li><strong>BERT fine-tuning</strong> (Week 7) - use pre-trained models</li>
<li><strong>GPT prompting</strong> (Week 8) - in-context learning experiments</li>
<li><strong>Probing classifier</strong> (Week 9) - test what models learn about syntax</li>
</ol>

<p>Plus: A <strong>final research proposal</strong> investigating a linguistic question with neural networks.</p>

<hr>

<h2>12. Instructor Note</h2>

<p>Welcome! This course moves fast, but we'll move together. My goal is to demystify neural networks—show you that they're not magic, just math and code. By Week 10, you'll be able to read an NLP paper and think "I could implement that."</p>

<p>The linguistics perspective is what makes this course special. We don't just ask "does it work?"—we ask "what does it learn?" and "what does that tell us about language?" This is the future of linguistics: using computational models as scientific instruments.</p>

<p>I'm excited to build models and test theories with you. Let's discover what neural networks can teach us about language.</p>

<p>Best, Utku Turk</p>

<h1>Advanced NLP & AI for Linguistics</h1>
<h3>Attention Probing, Causality, and Interpretability</h3>
<strong>LING 7XXX -- Winter Quarter 2027</strong>

<strong>Time:</strong> Wednesday 1:30pm--4:20pm (3 hours/week)

<strong>Location:</strong> TBD

<strong>Instructor:</strong> Utku Turk (<a href="mailto:utkuturk@umd.edu">utkuturk@umd.edu</a>)

<h2>1. Course Description</h2>

<p>What do neural language models actually learn? How can we probe their internal representations? Can we establish causal relationships between model components and linguistic behavior?</p>

<p>Neural networks are often treated as black boxes. In this seminar, we will open them up together. This advanced seminar explores cutting-edge methods for interpreting and analyzing neural networks through a linguistic lens. We focus on three core areas: (i) <strong>attention probing</strong>—analyzing attention patterns to understand how models process syntactic dependencies, (ii) <strong>causality and intervention</strong>—using counterfactual methods to establish causal relationships, and (iii) <strong>representation analysis</strong>—extracting and interpreting hidden representations for linguistic knowledge.</p>

<p>Students will learn to design rigorous probing experiments, implement causal intervention methods, analyze attention entropy and head specialization, and critically evaluate interpretability claims. This is a research-oriented seminar where students develop original proposals for investigating what neural models learn about language.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design and implement probing classifiers to test for linguistic knowledge.</li>
<li>Analyze attention patterns for syntactic dependencies and semantic roles.</li>
<li>Apply causal intervention methods (counterfactuals, interchange interventions).</li>
<li>Compute and interpret attention entropy and head specialization metrics.</li>
<li>Extract and visualize hidden representations using dimensionality reduction.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate interpretability claims and methodological choices.</li>
<li>Propose original research investigating model representations.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Research Seminar Format</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>research-level</strong> course. You'll read cutting-edge papers (many from 2024-2025), implement state-of-the-art methods, and develop original research proposals. I expect you to engage critically, propose extensions, and identify flaws in published work.</p>

<strong>Paper Presentation Rotation:</strong>
<p>You will lead discussion twice over the quarter. Your job:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Situate the work</strong> (2 min): What problem does this solve? Why does it matter?</li>
<li><strong>Explain the method</strong> (3 min): Walk us through the key technical contribution</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate the claims</strong> (3 min): What did they show? What did they NOT show?</li>
<li><strong>Propose extensions</strong> (2 min): How would you improve or extend this work?</li>
</ol>

<p>Prepare 3-5 discussion questions that get at the core tensions in the paper.</p>

<strong>Method Implementation Showcase:</strong>
<p>After implementing each method, you'll demonstrate it on a linguistic phenomenon of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 3: "Here's what my probing classifier found about verb transitivity..."</li>
<li>Week 5: "I discovered that attention head 7-3 specializes in..."</li>
<li>Week 7: "When I intervene on this representation, the model's predictions change because..."</li>
</ul>

<p>This builds your portfolio of interpretability tools AND helps you discover research questions.</p>

<h3>Tools and Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probing:</strong> Linear probes, control tasks, diagnostic classifiers.</li>
<li><strong>Attention analysis:</strong> Attention weights, entropy, rollout, head pruning.</li>
<li><strong>Causality:</strong> Counterfactual data, causal mediation, interchange interventions.</li>
<li><strong>Representation:</strong> PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, CKA similarity.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Hugging Face Transformers, AllenNLP Interpret, Captum.</li>

<h2>6. Policies</h2>

<h3>6.1 What you might struggle with (and how to succeed)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time management:</strong> This is advanced. Budget 10--12 hours/week outside class.</li>
<li><strong>Reading papers:</strong> Read strategically. Focus on methods and results. Take notes by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Implementing methods:</strong> Start with toy examples. Document as you go. Use Hugging Face extensively.</li>
<li><strong>Quarter pace:</strong> Week 3 (quarter) = Week 4-5 (semester). Very fast progression.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Interpretability code can be tricky. Use office hours. Share code snippets on Slack/Discord.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You may collaborate on understanding methods, but must implement your own code and write your own analyses. Cite all sources.</p>

<h3>6.3 Use of LLMs</h3>
<p>LLMs may be used for <strong>debugging</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong> code, but not for generating implementations. You must understand every line. Document any use.</p>

<h3>6.4 Accessibility & Wellness</h3>
<p>If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and talk to me early in the quarter. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.</p>

<h2>13. Relationship to Package 1 (Psycholinguistics)</h2>

<p>Students who complete both Package 1 (Psycholinguistics) and Package 2 (AI/NLP) can conduct cutting-edge research at their intersection:</p>

<h3>Research Questions You Can Answer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compare neural models with human processing:</strong></li>
<li>Do BERT's surprisal predictions match human reading times?</li>
<li>Do neural models show agreement attraction like humans?</li>
<li>Do attention patterns align with human garden-path effects?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use models to generate psycholinguistic stimuli:</strong></li>
<li>LLMs generate sentences → human experiments validate → probing checks what models learned</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model human errors:</strong></li>
<li>Build Bayesian models (Package 1, Course 2) of human agreement errors</li>
<li>Compare with neural model errors (Package 2, Course 2)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Combined Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiments + Models:</strong> Design human experiments (Package 1) and neural model probes (Package 2) to test the same theory</li>
<li><strong>Bayesian + Neural:</strong> Hierarchical Bayesian models (Package 1) compared with neural network models (Package 2)</li>
<li><strong>Production + NLP:</strong> Morphological planning (Package 1) tested in both humans and language models</li>
</ul>

<h2>14. Instructor Note</h2>

<p>This seminar is intense but rewarding. By Week 10, you'll have implemented multiple interpretability methods and proposed original research. Many students turn these projects into first-author publications.</p>

<p>The quarter format means we move fast—Week 3 you're already showcasing probing classifiers. But the research clinic format ensures you get individualized feedback and support.</p>

<p>I'm committed to helping you succeed. Use office hours, ask questions, share code on our class Slack. This is a collaborative research environment.</p>

<p>Looking forward to discovering what models learn about language—together.</p>

<p>Best, Utku Turk</p>
