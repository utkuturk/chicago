<h1>Package 1: Experimental Psycholinguistics Sequence</h1>
<strong>Instructor:</strong> Utku Turk (utkuturk@umd.edu)
<strong>Format:</strong> Quarter System (10 weeks per course)
<strong>Level Progression:</strong> Undergraduate → Mixed → Advanced Graduate

<hr>

<h2>Package Vision</h2>

<p>This three-course sequence trains students in experimental psycholinguistics, from foundational methods through computational modeling to specialized research in morphological planning. Students learn by doing: formulating questions, designing experiments, implementing models, collecting data, and presenting findings. Each course integrates programming (R, Stan, PCIbex), statistical analysis, and theoretical linguistics, preparing students for modern psycholinguistics research.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Course Summaries</h2>

<h3>Course 1: Introduction to Psycholinguistics (Undergraduate, Fall Quarter)</h3>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Introduction to Linguistics or permission

<p>Students learn psycholinguistics through the complete experimental process. Rather than just reading about experiments, they design them, collect data, analyze results, and present findings. The course covers speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing, and language production. By the end of the quarter, students have hands-on experience with self-paced reading, eye-tracking, acceptability judgments, and online experimentation (PCIbex, Gorilla). They learn R programming, mixed-effects models, and APA-format research writing. No prior experimental experience required—skills build from scratch.</p>

<strong>Key outputs:</strong> 4 QALMRI paper summaries, 3 stage projects (question formation, experimental design, data analysis), final experimental proposal.

<h3>Course 2: Bayesian Cognitive Modeling for Linguistics (Mixed Level, Winter Quarter)</h3>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Introduction to programming (R or Python) and basic statistics

<p>This course teaches students to formalize theories of cognition computationally using Bayesian modeling. Unlike traditional statistics ("is there an effect?"), cognitive modeling asks "what underlying process generated this data?" Students learn probabilistic programming in <strong>Stan</strong>, implementing models from Signal Detection Theory to hierarchical memory models. The workflow covers theory formalization, Stan implementation, parameter recovery through simulation, application to real data, and robustness evaluation. Mathematical intuition builds through visualization and analogy, not calculus.</p>

<strong>Key outputs:</strong> 7 weekly lab implementations, midterm model replication (SDT or GCM), final project implementing a novel Bayesian cognitive model.

<h3>Course 3: Morphological Planning in Production (Advanced Graduate, Spring Quarter)</h3>
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Background in psycholinguistics or permission

<p>This advanced seminar investigates when and how speakers plan inflectional morphology during sentence production. Students evaluate competing theoretical accounts (Levelt, Dell, Caramazza), design experiments that test explicit predictions, and build practical skills in PCIbex implementation, production timing analysis, and cross-linguistic design. The course runs as a <strong>studio/maker space</strong>—half our time is spent building experiments and debugging analyses together. Students develop original research proposals suitable for conference submission (HSP, LSA, CUNY) or publication in psycholinguistics journals.</p>

<strong>Key outputs:</strong> 3 problem sets (PCIbex build, R analysis pipeline, cross-linguistic design), article-format final project (10-15 pages) with preregistered analysis plan.

<hr>

<h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>

<p>This sequence embodies three core principles. <strong>First, learning by doing:</strong> students conduct research, not just read about it. <strong>Second, acting as colleagues:</strong> the instructor's role shifts from guide (Course 1) to mentor (Course 2) to collaborator (Course 3). <strong>Third, computational literacy:</strong> programming is embedded throughout as a tool for answering linguistic questions. Students completing all three courses can design rigorous experiments, implement computational models, and contribute original findings to the field.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Progression:</strong> Course 1 provides experimental foundations → Course 2 adds computational modeling → Course 3 integrates both in specialized research. Skills build cumulatively: R programming (all courses), experimental design (Courses 1 & 3), Bayesian modeling (Courses 2 & 3), production methods (Course 3).

<h1>Introduction to Psycholinguistics</h1>
<h3>Learning Through the Experimental Process</h3>

<strong>LING 2XXX -- Fall Quarter 2026</strong>

<strong>Time:</strong> TBD (meets 4 hours/week: 2 sessions of 2 hours each)

<strong>Location:</strong> TBD

<strong>Instructor:</strong> Utku Turk (<a href="mailto:utkuturk@umd.edu">utkuturk@umd.edu</a>)

<strong>Office hours:</strong> By appointment

<strong>Course site:</strong> Canvas

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Introduction to linguistics or permission. No prior experimental experience required.

<strong>Format:</strong> Quarter system (10 weeks)

<hr>

<h2>1. Course Description</h2>

<p>How do we study language in the mind? How do psycholinguists design experiments to test linguistic theories? What does it take to go from a theoretical question to publishable experimental results?</p>

<p>This course teaches psycholinguistics <strong>through the experimental process</strong>. Rather than just reading about experiments, we will learn by doing: formulating research questions, designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing results, and presenting findings. I am excited to guide you through this process as we act as colleagues discovering new things about the mind.</p>

<p>You will work through the complete research cycle multiple times, each time with a different linguistic domain: speech perception, lexical access, syntactic parsing, and language production. By the end of the quarter, you will have hands-on experience with every stage of psycholinguistic research and a deep understanding of how experimental methods connect to linguistic theory.</p>

<strong>No prior experimental experience required</strong>—we learn by doing, starting from scratch.

<hr>

<h2>2. Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Formulate testable research questions from linguistic theories.</li>
<li>Design experiments using appropriate psycholinguistic methods.</li>
<li>Understand and apply methods: self-paced reading, eye-tracking, acceptability judgments, priming.</li>
<li>Collect experimental data using online platforms (PCIbex, Gorilla).</li>
<li>Analyze psycholinguistic data using R and mixed-effects models.</li>
<li>Interpret experimental results in light of linguistic theory.</li>
<li>Write research papers following APA/journal format.</li>
<li>Present experimental findings to both specialist and general audiences.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate published psycholinguistic research.</li>
<li>Connect experimental findings to theoretical linguistics.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>3. Course Structure</h2>

<p>The course is organized around <strong>five stages of the experimental process</strong>. Each unit focuses on one stage and one linguistic phenomenon:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Question Formation</strong> (Week 1): Introduction to psycholinguistics & speech perception</li>
<li><strong>Literature Review</strong> (Weeks 2--3): Lexical access & word recognition</li>
<li><strong>Experimental Design</strong> (Weeks 4--5): Garden-path effects & parsing</li>
<li><strong>Data Collection</strong> (Weeks 6--7): Language Production & Planning</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis & Presentation</strong> (Weeks 8--10): Analysis methods & final projects</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. Policies</h2>

<h3>6.1 Quarter System Considerations</h3>

<p>This course covers substantial material in 10 weeks. To succeed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time management:</strong> Expect 10-12 hours/week outside class. Start assignments early.</li>
<li><strong>Reading strategy:</strong> Use the QALMRI framework. Focus on core readings; optional readings available for depth.</li>
<li><strong>Lab attendance:</strong> Critical—skills build cumulatively. Missing labs puts you behind.</li>
<li><strong>Office hours:</strong> Use them! Especially for R programming and experimental design help.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 What you might struggle with (and how to succeed)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning R:</strong> Start with small examples. Visualize everything. Use online resources (R for Data Science).</li>
<li><strong>Designing experiments:</strong> Start simple. Pilot everything. Get feedback early.</li>
<li><strong>Reading papers:</strong> Don't read linearly. Use QALMRI. Focus on method and results first.</li>
<li><strong>Quarter pace:</strong> Unlike semesters, there's no "catching up later." Stay current.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.3 Accessibility & Wellness</h3>

<p>If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and talk to me early in the quarter. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.</p>

<h3>6.4 Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Do your own work. You may collaborate on understanding concepts and debugging code, but write your own analyses and summaries. Cite all sources.</p>

<h3>6.5 Use of LLMs</h3>

<p>LLMs (ChatGPT, etc.) may be used for <strong>support</strong> (understanding concepts, debugging R code) but not to generate QALMRI summaries or written assignments. Document any use.</p>

<h1>Bayesian Cognitive Modeling for Linguistics</h1>
<h3>From Theory to Implementation</h3>
<strong>LING 4XXX -- Winter Quarter 2027</strong>

<strong>Time:</strong> TBD (meets 4 hours/week: 2 sessions of 2 hours each)

<strong>Location:</strong> TBD

<strong>Instructor:</strong> Utku Turk (<a href="mailto:utkuturk@umd.edu">utkuturk@umd.edu</a>)

<strong>Office hours:</strong> By appointment

<strong>Course site:</strong> Canvas

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Introduction to programming (R or Python) and basic statistics.

<strong>Format:</strong> Quarter system (10 weeks)

<hr>

<h2>1. Course Description</h2>

<p>How do we test theories of cognition? How can we formalize our hypotheses about how the mind works? This course introduces computational modeling as a tool for understanding cognitive processes, with a specific focus on <strong>Bayesian Cognitive Modeling</strong>.</p>

<p>Unlike data analysis, which asks "is there an effect?", cognitive modeling asks "what underlying process generated this data?". We will use the probabilistic programming language <strong>Stan</strong> to build, fit, and evaluate generative models of cognition. We will cover the full workflow: from defining a mathematical model of a cognitive process, to implementing it in code, to recovering parameters from simulated data, and finally applying it to real human behavioral data.</p>

<p>This course moves quickly through foundational material to give you hands-on experience with the most essential cognitive models.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Explain the purpose of quantitative modeling in cognitive science and distinguish among descriptive, predictive, and explanatory models.</li>
<li>Critically evaluate and implement simulations of cognitive models.</li>
<li>Implement Bayesian cognitive models using <strong>Stan</strong> and interpret their structure.</li>
<li>Evaluate the robustness of Bayesian cognitive models (parameter recovery, replication).</li>
<li>Clearly communicate the structure and performance of a Bayesian cognitive model.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>3. Course Content & Structure</h2>

<p>The course is divided into four main modules:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Foundations:</strong> Role of computational modeling; Simulation; Generative stance; Probability & Bayes.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Models:</strong> Parameter estimation, Signal Detection Theory, Latent variables (Stan implementation).</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical Structures:</strong> Pooling, shrinkage, individual differences.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Topics & Projects:</strong> Model comparison, mixture models, final projects.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Generative Stance</h3>
<p>This course teaches you to think like a <strong>theoretician</strong>. Instead of asking "what pattern is in the data?", you'll ask "if my theory is true, what data would I see?" This flips statistics on its head.</p>

<strong>Weekly Mathematical Intuition Building:</strong>

<p>Each week begins with a conceptual question before we touch code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Week 1: "If you flip a coin 10 times and get 7 heads, what can you infer about the coin's bias?"</li>
<li>Week 3: "How does Signal Detection Theory formalize the difference between sensitivity and bias?"</li>
<li>Week 5: "What does it mean for a model to 'pool' information across participants?"</li>
<li>Week 7: "Why do we need model comparison when all models are wrong?"</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll build mathematical intuition through simulation, visualization, and analogy—not calculus proofs.</p>

<h3>From Theory to Implementation</h3>

<p>Each model follows the same workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Formalize the theory</strong> (What are we claiming about cognition?)</li>
<li><strong>Specify the generative process</strong> (How would a god generate this data?)</li>
<li><strong>Implement in Stan</strong> (Translate the theory into code)</li>
<li><strong>Simulate fake data</strong> (Can we recover our parameters?)</li>
<li><strong>Apply to real data</strong> (Does the theory fit human behavior?)</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate robustness</strong> (Where does the model break?)</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. Policies</h2>

<h3>6.1 What you might struggle with (and how to succeed)</h3>

<strong>Coding in Stan:</strong> Stan can be challenging because it is declarative (you declare the model) rather than imperative. But don't worry—we will tackle this together, starting simple and building up complexity line by line.

<ul>
<li><strong>Start simple:</strong> Build the simplest possible model that compiles.</li>
<li><strong>Use the manual:</strong> The Stan User Guide is excellent.</li>
<li><strong>Simulate first:</strong> Always check if you can recover parameters from simulated data.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Bayesian concepts:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the <strong>generative process</strong>: "How would a god generate this data?"</li>
<li>Focus on interpreting the posterior distribution, not the integrals.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Quarter pace:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This course moves <strong>fast</strong>. Week 2 in quarter = Week 3-4 in semester.</li>
<li><strong>Don't fall behind</strong> on labs—each builds on the previous one.</li>
<li><strong>Use office hours</strong> extensively—debugging Stan code is part of learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You may collaborate on code, but you must write your own write-ups and understand every line of code you submit.</p>

<h3>6.3 Accessibility & Wellness</h3>
<p>If you need accommodations, please contact the relevant campus office and talk to me early in the quarter. If you are struggling—academically or personally—please reach out. I really appreciate when students communicate with me, and I'm happy to work with you to make a plan together.</p>

<h3>6.4 Use of LLMs</h3>
<p>LLMs may be used for <strong>debugging</strong> (e.g., understanding Stan error messages) but not for generating model code. Document any use.</p>

<h2>9. Connection to Course Sequence</h2>

<p>This course is <strong>Course 2</strong> in the Experimental Psycholinguistics sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Course 1:</strong> Intro to Psycholinguistics (undergrad) - Fall Quarter</li>
<li><strong>Course 2 (this course):</strong> Bayesian Cognitive Modeling (mixed) - Winter Quarter</li>
<li><strong>Course 3:</strong> Morphological Planning in Production (grad) - Spring Quarter</li>
</ul>

<strong>Skills from Course 1 that help here:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>R programming:</strong> You already know `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `lme4` from Course 1</li>
<li><strong>Mixed-effects models:</strong> Now extended to full Bayesian hierarchical models</li>
<li><strong>Experimental thinking:</strong> Now formalized as generative models</li>
</ul>

<strong>Skills developed here that transfer to Course 3:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bayesian analysis:</strong> Used for production latency models in Course 3</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical modeling:</strong> Applied to cross-linguistic experiments</li>
<li><strong>Parameter recovery:</strong> Used to validate complex production models</li>
</ul>

<strong>Can be taken standalone</strong> if you have programming and statistics background.

<hr>

<h2>10. Who Should Take This Course</h2>

<h3>Good fit if you:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Want to formalize theories of cognition computationally</li>
<li>Need Bayesian modeling skills for research</li>
<li>Took Course 1 (Intro Psycholing) and want deeper statistical skills</li>
<li>Are comfortable with programming and willing to learn Stan</li>
<li>Like thinking generatively ("what process could generate this data?")</li>
</ul>

<h3>May struggle if you:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Have no programming experience (take Course 1 first or learn R basics first)</li>
<li>Prefer plug-and-play statistics (this course emphasizes understanding over push-button tools)</li>
<li>Find 10-week quarters overwhelming</li>
</ul>

<h3>For graduate students:</h3>

<p>Especially valuable if your research involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modeling cognitive processes</li>
<li>Individual differences</li>
<li>Cross-linguistic comparisons requiring hierarchical models</li>
<li>Reaction time or accuracy data needing mixture models</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>11. Instructor Note</h2>

<p>This quarter moves fast, but the goal is the same: teach you to think like a modeler. By Week 10, you should be able to read a psycholinguistics paper and think "I could formalize that theory in Stan and test whether it recovers the behavioral pattern."</p>

<p>Stan has a learning curve, but it's worth it. Once you learn Stan, you can model anything—not just language, but vision, memory, decision-making, clinical data, and more. This skill is valuable in academia and industry.</p>

<p>I'm committed to helping you succeed. Use office hours, ask questions, debug together. We'll get through it together.</p>

<p>Looking forward to building models with you.</p>

<p>Best, Utku Turk</p>

<strong>Methods spine (recurring):</strong> <a href="https://experimentology.io"><em>Experimentology</em></a>

<strong>Format:</strong> Quarter system (10 weeks)

<hr>

<h2>1. Course Description</h2>

<p>When do we plan inflectional morphology? This seminar connects theory about production and morphological encoding to experiments that can test it. You will evaluate core claims, design studies with explicit predictions, and build practical skills in implementation, analysis, and modeling. Think of us as colleagues working on the same project together—my goal is to help you develop the best possible project, not just evaluate it at the end. The quarter ends with an original proposal or pilot, written in article format.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluate competing accounts of morphological planning in production.</li>
<li>Turn theoretical claims into concrete predictions and falsifiable tests.</li>
<li>Design experiments with appropriate controls, counterbalancing, and exclusions.</li>
<li>Implement web-based production tasks in PCIbex (timing + audio).</li>
<li>Analyze timing/error data in R (mixed models).</li>
<li>Design cross-linguistic experiments that test morphological planning.</li>
<li>Conduct power analyses and interpret model comparison metrics.</li>
<li>Present and defend an experimental design.</li>
<li>Write preregistered analysis plans with reproducible workflows.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Studio Model</h3>
<p>This seminar runs like an <strong>art studio</strong> or <strong>maker space</strong>—not a lecture hall. Half our time is spent building: writing code, designing experiments, debugging analyses. I'll circulate and work with you individually or in small groups.</p>

<strong>Expect to:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Show unfinished work and get feedback (that's how we learn!)</li>
<li>Help each other debug code and brainstorm designs</li>
<li>Present work-in-progress multiple times, not just at the end</li>
<li>Iterate based on peer and instructor feedback</li>
</ul>

<strong>Studio Sessions Include:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 3</strong>: PCIbex build-athon—bring your laptop, build a minimal naming experiment</li>
<li><strong>Week 5</strong>: Analysis clinic—bring your data, we'll wrangle it together</li>
<li><strong>Week 7</strong>: Design workshop—pitch your final project idea, get feedback</li>
<li><strong>Week 9</strong>: Cross-linguistic design exchange—pair up and critique each other's designs</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Collaborative Approach</h3>
<strong>Think of us as colleagues working on the same project together.</strong> Reach out anytime with questions about your design, feedback on materials, or coding problems.
